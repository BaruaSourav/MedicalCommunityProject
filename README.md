## Background
Centralizing the health information will definitely increase the efficiency of activities that are held on a generic patient-doctor scenario. If the project is conducted voluntarily then the monetizing scope of the project will, by providing different tariff plans to limit and classify the Doctor User classâ€™s EHR features. Nonetheless, if the project is conducted by government funding then this project will provide a streamlined solution to the medical personnel and different stakeholders like: Diagnostic Laboratories, Medical Students, Pharmaceutical Companies, Medical Survey Conductors.
